"""
 This file performs leave-one-subject cross-subject classification on the driver drowsiness dataset.
 The data file contains 3 variables and they are EEGsample, substate and subindex.
 "EEGsample" contains 2022 EEG samples of size 30x384 from 11 subjects. 
 Each sample is a 3s EEG data with 128Hz from 30 EEG channels.

 The names and their corresponding index are shown below:
 Fp1, Fp2, F7, F3, Fz, F4, F8, FT7, FC3, FCZ, FC4, FT8, T3, C3, Cz, C4, T4, TP7, CP3, CPz, CP4, TP8, T5, P3, PZ, P4, T6, O1, Oz  O2

 "subindex" is an array of 2022x1. It contains the subject indexes from 1-11 corresponding to each EEG sample. 
 "substate" is an array of 2022x1. It contains the labels of the samples. 0 corresponds to the alert state and 1 correspond to the drowsy state.
 
  The dataset can be downloaded here:
  https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/EEG_driver_drowsiness_dataset/14273687
 
  This file prints leave-one-out accuracies for each subject and the overall accuracy.
  The overall accuracy for one run is around 0.78
